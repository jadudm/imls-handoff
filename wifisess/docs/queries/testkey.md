## Test your key

We have [a simple web page for you to test your key](https://federalist-126760f7-e6ff-4146-9b00-e8966a80d7f0.app.cloud.gov/site/cantsin/10x-shared-components-phase-3/explore/).

1. Enter your key
2. Look for an FCFS_Seq_Id that is part of the pilot. We have two test IDs: `CA0001-001` and `ME0064-001`. 
3. Look for a device tag in those FCFS Ids. In this case, each of the test devices has a different tag: California is `in the depths of Z'ha'dum` and Maine is `in the basement`. 

If your key works, you'll get something back. (It might be that you get *nothing* back; however, if you see a graph come up---even if it is empty---it means that the key worked.) 

If the key does not work, you will get an error, and the page will show it. 

(We don't know how robust this test is. It was written quickly, and last. We believe it is *good enough* for the librarians who are taking part in the pilot to find out if their devices are running after they set them up. That's the intent/limit of what we intended this page for. If you encounter problems with the test page, please let us know, submit patches, etc.)
