For the pilot, we settled on the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) as an implementation platform. It is low-cost open hardware, and is readily available both from brick-and-mortar retailers as well as many web outlets.

For the pilot, we used the [Model 4b](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/).This makes it a quad-core, 1.5GHz ARM-based Debian device with 4GB of RAM. We have also tested on a 3B+ with 1GB of RAM.

It is our belief that a low-spec model (3B or 4B with 1GB or 2GB of RAM) and a 16GB microSD card or larger will more-than-adequately work as a platform for this pilot.

## For the Future

It is possible for an old Intel-based laptop or computer to serve as the host for this project. We believe the number of changes required (to adapt to the new operating system) far outweigh the low cost and ready availability of the Raspberry Pi.
